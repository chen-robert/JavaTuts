# Java Course
This is the GitHub repository for all the answers to the Educere Java Course. These programs are my ways of doing/solving the program. Feel free to modify or improve the program in your own files if you feel the need to. Please do not fork or distribute the repository.

I posted this repository with the intention of helping myself. Please only refer to this as a reference and not as an easy way to copy. PLEASE DO NOT DIRECTLY COPY!!
